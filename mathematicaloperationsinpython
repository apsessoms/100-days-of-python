3 + 5
7 - 3

#instead of using the x symbol, you will use the * asteric

3*2 

6/3 is 6 divided by 3
print(6 / 3) will give you an answer of 2
an important note about divison is that your answer will most always result in an floating number. 
lets type check it....
print(type(6 / 3))
<class 'float'>      instead of integer and this just happens with division in python

two ** signs gives you access to an exponent 

2**2 is 
print(2 ** 2)
4

when you have more than one operation on the same line of code there is a prioroty level...PEMDAS
